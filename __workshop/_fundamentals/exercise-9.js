// Exercise 9
// -------------
//
// Write a function that accepts a string and returns the string wrapped to 40 characters per line.
// This means you'll have to insert a newline character after
// every 40 characters in the input string.
//
// - If the next character after a cut is a space, then do not display it.
// - To represent a newline character, you can use "\n".

const wrapAfter40Chars = (paragraph) => {
  // Your code here
    let letters = [],
    i = 0;
    let step = 40
    while (i < paragraph.length) {
      letters.push(paragraph.slice(i,  i+= step));
    }
    return letters.map(line => line.trimStart()).join('\n');
};
let str = "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book."

console.log(
  wrapAfter40Chars(str)
)

console.log(
 Math.round(str.length / 40)
)

// Part 2 - Test
// --------------
// Test your function.
// Look for the corresponding exercise file in the __tests__ folder.
// Add some test cases in the test. The first one is done for you.

// We need to export the function in order for our unit test to have access to it.
module.exports = wrapAfter40Chars;
